I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Going through a hard time
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Did you make fun of me
You played a joke on me
Although you said you're so in love with me
Which part of him made you
Falling in love with him
Did you already get tired of me
I wanna dance with you holding your lovely hand
Among all these bunch of people
All I see
Your smile stands out and shines for me
It's all I can see
Love me again
I will not be single now
As you said before anymore
Or is it only me
Who thinks we were in love
It does matter anymore
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Let the sunshine on me
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Single life's on the run
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
The world I found in front of me
Is such a mess
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Going through a hard time
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Let's forget everything
Just let me dance tonight
Throw away all my worries of yesterday
Who will you choose next
To spend your time with
To share your heart and all of your love
I wanna hold you tight tonight
And fall asleep
With your undeniable beauty
Please fulfill
My heart so dried up like a desert
Without you my love
True love is blind
Yes I made mistakes
But your heart was to change
I hope
I can see my heart
And be you again
I gotta control it somehow
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I see you with him
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
You smile more with him
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
When you touch his hand
It's such an agony for me
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Going through a hard time
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Break it down
I need you with me
Even without loving me
I'm such a loser
Like a doll
You can cheat on me
If I can't be with you
It does matter anymore
Love me again
I will not be single now
As you said before anymore
Or is it only me
Who thinks we were in love
It does matter anymore
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Let the sunshine on me
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Single life's on the run
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
The world I found in front of me
Is such a mess
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
Going through a hard time
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
I'm a lucky girl
